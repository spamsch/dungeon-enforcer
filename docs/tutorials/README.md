## Getting Help

Each tutorial has sections you can reference when asking for help:

> "Help with Tutorial 02, Part C - random point navigation"

This helps me give you targeted assistance without spoiling the rest.

## Recommended Path

```
01 (Pause) ──→ 02 (Idle) ──→ 03 (Selection)
                                    │
                                    ▼
                            04 (Digging) ──→ 05 (Gold)
```

Start with **01** and **02** to get comfortable, then **04** is the big core feature.
