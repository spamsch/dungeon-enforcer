# Dungeon Enforcer

A personal exploration project inspired by Dungeon Keeper 2, built with Godot 4.5.

## What is this?

This is my playground for learning Godot game development. I'm building a dungeon management game prototype while experimenting with:

- 3D navigation and pathfinding
- Click-to-move mechanics
- PBR materials and lighting
- Scene management and game states

## Current State

Early prototype with:
- One dungeon room
- A creature that follows click commands
- Basic menu system

## Running

Requires Godot 4.5. Open the project in the Godot editor and hit Play.

## License

Personal project - not intended for distribution.
